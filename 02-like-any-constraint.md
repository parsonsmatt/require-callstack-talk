# `RequireCallStack` is like any other constraint

 
- When you call a function that uses the constraint,
  you can either:

    1. Discharge the constraint
    2. Propagate the constraint


- Let's consider an example with types you may be
  more familiar with:
    
    `MonadIO`

    `MonadError`
